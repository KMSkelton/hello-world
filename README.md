# hello-world
Following along with the GitHub tutorial.
I mentioned that I ought to work on this to help others grok my worldview. Some may find it useful to know that I inherently knew that grok as a verb is spelled with one "k" and its transitive variations are "grokked" and "grokking" though one "groks" a thing. 
Anyway, I'm working on learning JavaScript. I'm reading/exercising my way through Head First Javascript Programming and will attend Code Fellows in February/March of 2015. I'm passably good with HTML and CSS, though a lack of projects has kept me from using that skillset.
I'm also working (slowly) on a volunteer scheduling database in MySQL and Ruby on Rails.
I've dorked around with Codecademy and Code School, but haven't put much serious effort into web programming.
